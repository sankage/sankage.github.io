A secondary project at Infosurv was to build a Survey and Reporting Tool (SRT). This project was meant to take the place of our existing survey software. My work in the project was in the frontend design and construction. 

The software was designed to manage clients and their associated projects.

A client would have many projects:

For the surveys that made up a project, they would each have a dashboard:

Survey construction would happen in the builder:

Unfortunately the project didn't make it very far into the mockup/prototype phase before it got mothballed.
