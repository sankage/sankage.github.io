Its almost always easier to understand data when you can visualize it. To help make data more understandable for the Smile Brands reporting portal, I implemented some charts with the [Raphaël.js](http://raphaeljs.com/) library.

I also had been meddling with the Raphaël library earlier while working on the SRT.
